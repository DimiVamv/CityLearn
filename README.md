# CityLearn
CityLearn is  an open source OpenAI Gym environment for the implementation of reinforcement learning in demand response applications.
The environment receives the heating and cooling loads of multiple buildings, as well as a weather file, as inputs. It contains multiple Python classes that can model the energy supply devices (i.e., heat pumps), and the energy storage devices (i.e., batteries, chilled water tanks, or hot water tanks). These classes are assigned to specific buildings, and then controlled by the reinforcement learning agents that the user must provide.
We also provide an example of a reinforcement learning implementation. In particular, we implement the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) to control 10 buildings under the climatic conditions of Austin, TX. In our example, the price of electicity increases proportionally with the total demand for electricity of the 10 buildings, which rises the cost of electricity for each building. The buildings must learn how to coordinate in such a way that they don't only reduce the consumption of electricity, but also the amount of electricity that they all consume simultaneously. This example is provided as a jupyter notebook file: 'main'.
